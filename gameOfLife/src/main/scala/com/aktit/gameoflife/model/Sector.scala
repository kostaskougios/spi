	  * Plays 1 turn of the game of life.
	  *
	  * Rules (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
	  *
	  * The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which
	  * is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell
	  * interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
	  * adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
	  *
	  * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
	  * Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
	  * Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
	  * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
	  *
	  * The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above
	  * rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment
	  * at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one.
	  * The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
	  *
